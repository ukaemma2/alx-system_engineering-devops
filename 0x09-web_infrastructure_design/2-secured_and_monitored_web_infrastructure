Additional Elements and Their Purpose:

Firewalls: The three firewalls are added to provide an additional layer of security and protect the infrastructure from unauthorized access and cyber-attacks.
SSL Certificate: The SSL certificate is added to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS, which encrypts the communication between the server and the client and prevents any eavesdropping or data interception.
Monitoring Clients: The three monitoring clients are added to collect data and provide real-time information about the infrastructure's health and performance.

Why Firewalls are Needed:

Firewalls are needed to secure the infrastructure and protect it from unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. They help to filter traffic and prevent malicious traffic from reaching the servers, which reduces the risk of a security breach.

Why Traffic is Served over HTTPS:

HTTPS is used to encrypt the communication between the server and the client, which
prevents any eavesdropping or data interception. It also helps to establish the authenticity of the website and provides assurance that the website is legitimate and not a fake site created by hackers to steal sensitive information.

Why Monitoring is Used:

Monitoring is used to provide real-time information about the infrastructure's health and 
performance. It helps to detect and fix any issues or errors before they become critical, which reduces downtime and ensures that the website is always available and running smoothly.

How Monitoring Tool is Collecting Data:

The monitoring tool collects data by installing agents on the servers, which collect and send data to the monitoring client. The monitoring client then aggregates and analyzes the data, which is displayed on a dashboard for real-time monitoring.

Monitoring Web Server QPS:

To monitor web server QPS (queries per second), we can use a monitoring tool that can track web server metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network traffic. By analyzing these metrics, we can determine the web server QPS and identify any performance bottlenecks.

Issues with This Infrastructure:

Terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue because it reduces the security of the infrastructure. If the SSL certificate is terminated at the load balancer level, the communication between the load balancer and the servers is not encrypted, which increases the risk of data interception and cyber-attacks.
Having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue because it creates a single point of failure. If the MySQL server fails, the website will not be able to accept any writes, which can lead to data loss and downtime.
Having servers with all the same components (database, web server, and application server) might be a problem because it increases the risk of a single
